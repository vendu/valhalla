Valhalla Processor Unit 0 - Machine Architecture
------------------------------------------------

Preface
-------

Valhalla 0 is a processor architecture designed for experimenting with
implementing new development tools as well as teaching and learning machine-
level programming.

Valhalla was designed with simplicity in mind. It's RISC-centric with a few
additions to make the life of compiler implementors easier. The goal is to be
human-programmable in assembly; the mission is for it to be usable for teaching
and learning assembly programming on a system resembling common existing
microprocessors.

The instruction set design was heavily inspired by the C programming language.

Addressing Modes
----------------

V0_REG_ADR      - register argument
V0_DIR_ADR      - direct address, i.e. memory word following the opcode
V0_NDX_ADR      - indexed address, base in register, index in val- or argument
V0_PIC_ADR      - PC-relative, if val is non-zero val(%pc),
                  otherwise op->val(%pc) (for branch-instructions only)

V0_REG_ADR
----------

The instruction argument is in a register. This is the most common operand
type.

V0_DIR_ADR
----------

The argument is either in the val-field of the opcode or the word following the
opcode in memory (depending on the instruction).

V0_NDX_ADR
----------

The argument is located so that the register contains the base address whereas
the val-field is the index. For example, the C statement

        val = ptr[NDX];

could translate to

        ptr[op->val << op->parm];

Notice that the parm-field of the opcode is used as a scaling shift count for
the address; for 8-bit bytes, this scaling-factor is 0.

V0_PIC_ADR
----------

This PC-relative (PC is the program counter aka instruction pointer register)
was added to aid translating position independent code. In case the val-field
of the opcode is not zero, the address will be calculated as

        pc[op->val << op->parm] -

if the val-field is zero, the address will be

        pc[op->arg[0].ndx];

Instruction Set
---------------

As Valhalla 0 is a load-store architecture, operands for most instructions are
in registers with the exceptions of certain memory- and stack-modification
instructions dealing with memory address arguments.

The following is a list of descriptions for different argument types.

r  - value in register
m  - memory address
n  - indexed address
i  - immediate argument; may be stored in the val-field of the instruction or
     an extra machine-word following the instruction in memory
p  - PC-relative (position-independent)

NOT     r1              bitwise negation (reverse all bits)
AND     ri1, r2         bitwise and
OR      ri1, r2         bitwise or
XOR     ri1, r2         bitwise exclusive or

NOTE
----
- the shift instructions take their immediate argument in opcode val-field
SHL     ri1, r2         shift left (immediate value in val-field)
SHR     ri1, r2         shift right
SAR     ri1, r2         shift right arithmetic (fill with sign)

NOTE
----
- for arithmetic-unit instructions immediate argument follows instruction
INC     r1              increment register by one
DEC     r1              decrement register by one
ADD     ri1, r2         add argument 1 to register 2
ADC	ri1, r2         add argument 1 to register 2, set carry-bit
SUB	ri1, r2         subtract argument 1 from register 2
SBB	ri1, r2         subtract argument 1 from register 2, set carry-bit
CMP	ri1, r2         compare argument 1 with register 2, set flag-bits
MUL	ri1, r2         multiply register 2 by argument 1
DIV	ri1, r2         divide register 2 by argument 1
REM	ri1, r2         return remainder of register 2 divided by argument 1

NOTE
----
- branch instructions support following addressing modes:
- r: V0_REG_ADR    target address in register 1
- n: V0_NDX_ADR    reg1[op->val << op->parm]
- i: V0_DIR_ADR    op->arg[0].adr (32-bit address follows opcode)
- p: V0_PIC_ADR    (op->val) ? pc[op->val << op->parm] : pc[op->arg[0].ndx]
                   - if op->val is non-zero, index pc with it, scale by op->parm
                     - otherwise, index pc with 32-bit index following opcode
JMP     rnip1
BZ      rnip1
BNZ     rnip1
BC      rnip1
BNC     rnip1
BO      rnip1
BNO     rnip1
BEQ     rnip1
BLT     rnip1
BLE     rnip1
BGT     rnip1
BGE     rnip1

NOTES
-----
- CPL takes two arguments
  - r1 is count of call arguments in p2->args
  - p2 is address of struct { v0ureg vc; v0reg *args; }
    - vc is number of _callee_ automatic/stack variables
    - args is base address of table of r1 arguments
      - up to 6 stored in registers r0..r5
      - the rest on stack as if pushed in right-to-left order
      - r6 will be set to r1 (argument count)
      - r7 will be set to vc (automatic/stack variable count)
- CALL takes arguments like the branch instructions (see above)
CPL     r1, p2              [function] call prologue
CALL    rnip1               trigger function call (pushes return address)
ENTER   N/A                 create sub-routine stack frame
LEAVE   N/A                 destroy sub-routine stack frame
RET     N/A                 return from sub-routine

NOTES
-----
- the non-register argument for LDR or STR may be
  - register
  - indexed address reg[op->val << op->parm]
  - direct address op->arg[0].adr (32-bit address follows opcode)
LDR     rnim1, r2
STR     r1, rnim2

NOTES
-----
- the argument for PSH may be
  - register
  - immediate value op->arg[0].i32 (follows opcode)
- the argument for POP must be a register
- PSHM and POPM take two arguments in 5-bit op->val low- and high-fields
  - lo and hi define the range of registers to be pushed
PSH    ri1
POP    r1
PSHM   lo, hi
POPM   lo, hi

NOTES
-----
- the first argument (port) of IOR or IOW is stored in the val-field of opcode
- the second argument must be a register
IOR     p, r            p is port number in val-field)
IOW     p, r
